# BufferOverflowExploit
These python scripts can be used to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a server. These scripts work for servers with no memory protection enabled. These scripts are ordered in a step by step manner. The name of the script explains the function of the code. 
The order to execute the scripts is:
  1. spiking_script.py
  2. findoffset.py
  3. overwrite_EIP.py
  4. finding_right_module.py
  5. overflow.py
  
 
 # Note: These scripts were tested against vulnserver which is intensionally vulnerble.
